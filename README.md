# MetaMask-wallets-PostgreSQL-userDB

To create user accounts in a PostgreSQL database from MetaMask wallets, you can use the following steps:

- Connect to your PostgreSQL database using a client such as psql or pgAdmin.
- Run the following SQL command to create a new user:

```
CREATE USER <username> WITH PASSWORD '<password>';
```
Replace <username> with the desired username and <password> with the desired password.

- Optionally, you can grant the new user various privileges by running SQL commands such as GRANT CONNECT SQL and GRANT CREATE TABLE. Consult the PostgreSQL documentation for a full list of available privileges and how to grant them.
- You can use the MetaMask API to retrieve the user's Ethereum address, which you can then use as the identifier for the user's account in your application.
- You can store the user's Ethereum address, username, and password in your PostgreSQL database, mapping the Ethereum address to the username and password. This will allow you to authenticate the user in your application using their Ethereum address and the stored username and password.
